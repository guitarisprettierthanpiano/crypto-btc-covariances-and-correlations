# crypto-btc-covariances-and-correlations

Hi and welcome to my bitcoin covariances and correlations project. This will show you that data of coins paired with BTC. Nothing like this exists (as far as I can tell) on the internet.
This took me only a few days to complete and could potentially be very useful to the right kind of people. 

First it fetches the top 50 market cap coins from Coingeko. 
Second it fetches their prices over the last 30 days and calculates the data you see in the table.
It is a simple idea but quite powerful indeed. Enjoy!

Tools used: useEffect, fetch, async and await, HashRouter, Switch, Router, NavLink

Dependencies: react-mathjax3

This website isn't optimized for phones because it is impossible to view the whole table on a screen of that size. So use a tablet or anything larger than that.
