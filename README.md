Hi and welcome to my bitcoin correlations project. This will show you the price correlations of popular cryptocurrencies paired with BTC.

* If a correlation is 1, it means the two assets move perfectly together.
* If a correlation is 0, it means the two assets move independently.
* If a correlation is -1, it means the two assets move completely opposite of each other.

It works like this:

1. Fetches the names of top the 50 market cap coins from Coingeko.
2. Fetches their prices over each of the last 30 days.
3. Calculates the data you see in the table, forumlas shown in the FAQ page.
4. Creates the table from just table headers and fills it in with the data fetched data.
